    <p>
        This is a paragraph about the webpage that I will develop. I have no idea as to what this page will be about. Maybe something about webpages and HTML.
        Who knows? This is something that I will contine to think about and make a determination as we progress forward in the lesson or course. Let us see what
        happens in the next few days.
